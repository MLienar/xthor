            <h2>Gonna make some WAVES</h2>
            <p>xThor is based on the Waves Blockchain, the 61st ranked crypto on Binance. With a 140M $ market cap, WAVES is the up and coming cryptocurrency. <br><br>
            Not being based on the Bitcoin blockchain allows xThor to avoid the common pitfalls of other cryptos and stand tall even when the market goes down.</p>

            <p>The crypto market is so volatile that it makes it impossible for anyone without inside infromation to make any money from it. That isn’t acceptable to us. xThor was made to take crypto investment back to the basics : smart moves and speculation make money, dumb ones don’t.</p>
